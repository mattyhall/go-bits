# go-bits
go-bits is a Go package that allows you to store and write bits to a io.Writer and then read them back from an io.Reader.

There are a number of reasons why you may want to write single bits and to do this with just the standard library at the moment you would have
to do some bit shifting yourself. This library handles that for you.

Documentation is available at http://godoc.org/github.com/mattyhall/go-bits/bits or see example.go for an example of use.

Pull requests, issues and thoughts are all welcome.
